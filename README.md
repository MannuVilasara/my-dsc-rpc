to use it make sure you have these dependencies installed `python-pypresence`,`python-psutil`,`python-colorama`.

you can test the script by creating vritual environment and running the following command to install the required dependencies in the vritual environment.
```bash

You are free to change the source however u want.

open discord and try running the below command
```bash
python3 my-dsc-rpc/main.py
```
once u are sure it works you can run the following command to install it in ur os.
```bash
